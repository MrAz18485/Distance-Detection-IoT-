# Distance Detection IoT Project

Designed a IoT project that uses HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor which offers detection from 2 cm up to 3 meters. The sensor detects objects using reflection of ultrasonic pulses.
Used SSD1306 display which displays information about whether if there is an object in range or not. If there is, it displays the distance in both centimeters(cm in SI) and meters (m in SI)
There is also 2 LEDs which are red and green. Green LED lights up when the object is in range between 50 and 20 centimeters to the sensor, while red LED lights up when the object is below 20 centimeters in range.
The display screen warns the user about the object when distance is less than 20 centimeters.

Despite being a prototype, the design could be further evaluated into a more useful form.
